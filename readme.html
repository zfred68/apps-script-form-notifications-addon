 Form Notifications Add-on for Google Forms

A sample Google Apps Script add-on for Google Forms.

Introduction

Google Apps Script allows developers to construct 'add-ons' -- small applications which extend and support Google Docs, Google Sheets, and now Google Forms.

This sample shows how to construct a Google Forms add-on called Form Notifications. This add-on allows Form creators to automatically send email notifications when a form is submitted. In addition, the add-on allows form creators to be notified when they have received responses.

This sample makes use of the following Apps Script concepts:

Google Forms Add-ons
Events and Triggers (specifically, onFormSubmit triggers)
Templated HTML
Dialogs and Sidebars
Sending Email with Apps Script
Getting Started

You can install the Form Notifications add-on from the add-on store.

If you would like to try re-building it yourself, you can follow the directions provided in the Add-on for Google Forms Quickstart documentation.
